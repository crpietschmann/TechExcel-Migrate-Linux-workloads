# Task 05 - Deploy and configure Azure Firewall

## Introduction

Terra Firm Laboratories is migrating their on-premises Linux workloads to Microsoft Azure. In this task, you will implement an Azure Firewall to protect network traffic. You will use the on-premises workload server to simulate a situation where a server has been migrated to Azure and it needs outgoing internet access cut to it.

## Description

In this task, you will implement an Azure Firewall to protect network traffic.

The key tasks are as follows:

1. Test network traffic from the Virtual Machine to the Internet. You should have access to bing.com.
1. Deploy Azure Firewall.
1. Configure rules to block access to bing.com.
1. Test network traffic from the Virtual Machine to the Internet. Access to bing.com is now blocked.

## Success Criteria

* Azure Firewall is deployed and fully working.

## Solution

1. Select **Review + create** and then select **Create**.

    >**Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete. This should take about 5 minutes.

1. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box at the top of the Azure portal page, type **Resource groups** and press the **Enter** key.

1. On the **Resource groups** blade, in the list of resource groups, select **YOUR RESOURCE GROUP** entry.

1. In the list of resources, select the entry representing the **afw-onprem-001** firewall.

1. On the **afw-onprem-001** blade, identify the **Private IP** address that was assigned to the firewall.

1. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box at the top of the Azure portal page, type **Route tables** and press the **Enter** key.

1. On the **Route tables** blade, click **+ Create**.

1. On the **Create route table** blade, specify the following settings:

    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Resource group|**YOUR RESOURCE GROUP**|
    |Region| **Your Region**|
    |Name|**rt-onprem-001**|

1. Click **Review + create**, then click **Create**, and wait for the provisioning to complete. 

1. On the **Route tables** blade, click **Refresh**, and, in the list of route tables, click the **rt-onprem-001** entry.

1. On the **rt-onprem-001** blade, in the **Settings** section, click **Subnets** and then, on the **rt-onprem-001 \| Subnets** blade, click **+ Associate**.

1. On the **Associate subnet** blade, specify the following settings:

    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Virtual network|**terrafirm-onprem-vnet**|
    |Subnet|**default**|

     >**Note**: Ensure the **default** subnet is selected for this route, otherwise the firewall won't work correctly.

1. Click **OK** to associate the firewall to the virtual network subnet.

1. Back on the **rt-onprem-001** blade, in the **Settings** section, click **Routes** and then click **+ Add**.

1. On the **Add route** blade, specify the following settings:

    >**Note**: Connection should be blocked due to the Azure Firewall.

    ![Testing the firewall rule denying access to all of the internet.](../../resources/images/lab04_05_NetworkWatcher_TestingFirewallRule.png "Network Watcher Test")

Congratulations! You have successfully used the Azure Firewall to remove outgoing internet access and a quick test of trying to SSH to the public address of the server will show that it has been removed.  

A quick test would be to try and SSH to the public address of the `terrafirm-onprem-workload-vm` which should fail and then try and access it via the Bastion host - which will succeed.
