# Exercise 03 - Enable Azure Arc

## Lab Scenario

In this exercise, you will Azure Arc-enable a Linux Server VM that Terra Firm Laboratories has on-premises. This VM is being Arc-enabled since there are no plans to migrate it to Azure, but Terra Firm would like to simplify the management of all their VMs in a single place. Azure Arc provides the functionality to manage Azure and on-premises VMs in a single place giving Terra Firm exactly what they are looking for to simplify VM management and administration.

## Objectives

After you complete this exercise, you will be able to:

* Configure an on-prem VM to be Arc-enabled
* Manage an Arc-enable Virtual Machine via the Azure Portal

## Lab Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 45 minutes
