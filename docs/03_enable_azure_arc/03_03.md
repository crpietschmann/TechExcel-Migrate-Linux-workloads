1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to the Resource Group for the lab.

1. Scroll down and locate the Azure resource of type **Machine - Azure Arc**. and select it.

1. This is the **Machine - Azure Arc** pane for the on-premises virtual machine that was just Azure Arc-enabled. The **Status** shows **Connected** to signify that the Azure Arc-enabled virtual machine is connected to Azure. Also, notice that the **Computer Name** and **Operating System** of the virtual machine are displayed.

1. From here, there are several **Azure Arc** capabilities available to use for managing the Azure Arc-enabled virtual machine.

1. Select **Extensions** under **Settings**. This is where you can install Extensions on the Azure Arc-enabled virtual machine. For example, the **Custom script for linux - Azure Arc** extension can be used to download scripts and files from Azure storage and launch a script on the machine.
