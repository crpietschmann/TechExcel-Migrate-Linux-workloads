# Task 01 - Configure the migrated database for connectivity from the web application connection

## Description

In this task, you will connect to the migrated database in the Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server. You will configure the database to allow connectivity from the web application running on the VM to connect to the migrated PostgreSQL database.

## Success Criteria

* The database is configured for the web application to connect to it.

## Solution

1. In the **Azure Portal**, navigate to the **Resource Group** that you created for this lab, then select the Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server you just created.

1. Go to Networking in the left hand pane or search for `Networking` in search

    ![Networking is hihghlighted.](../../resources/images/lab02_01_PostgreSQLFlexibleServer_Network.png "Networking")

1. Click on the Private Endpoin link

     ![Click on the private endpoint link](../../resources/images/lab02_01_PostgreSQLFlexibleServer_PrivateEndpoint_1.png "Private EndPoint")

1. Click on DNS configuration or use search to find it

    ![Click on the DNS configuration option](../../resources/images/lab02_01_PostgreSQLFlexibleServer_PrivateEndpoint_2.png "DNS configuration")

1. This will bring up the IP address that the private endpoint for PostgreSQL Flexible Server is using. You will use this IP address to connect via the bastion session.

    ![Obtaining the IP address for connecting to the Private Endpoint](../../resources/images/lab02_01_PostgreSQLFlexibleServer_PrivateEndpoint_3.png "IP Address")

1. In the **Azure Portal**, navigate to the **Resource Group** that you created for this lab, then select the **On-premises APP VM** named similar to `terrafirm-onprem-app-vm`.

    ![The Resource group with on-premises workload VM highlighted.](../../resources/images/lab02_02_VirtualMachine.png "Azure resource group")

1. On the **Virtual Machine** blade, either use the Search function in the left hand menu or click on Bastion. We will use a bastion host as the method to connect to our VMs as this is a more secure method.

    ![The Virtual machine blade searching for "Bastion".](../../resources/images/lab00_02_BastionSearch.png "Search for Bastion")

    ![The Virtual machine blade with Bastion selected.](../../resources/images/lab00_02_Bastion.png "Bastion")

1. Within the **Bastion** page, enter the following:
    1. **Authentication Type**    VM Password
    1. **Username**               demouser
    1. **VM Password**            <`the secure password you created when you created the VMs in Task01`>

     ![The Bastion Connection page.](../../resources/images/lab00_02_BastionConnection.png "Setup for Bastion")

    >**Note**: You may need to allow popups if they are blocked in your browser.

1. When connectioned to the VM via the Bastion host you will get a screen like this:

    ![Copnnection via Bastion host.](../../resources/images/lab00_02_BastionConnected.png "Bastion Connected")

1. Once connected via Bastion, run the following command to install the git utility on the server by using the clipboard within the session:

    ![Clipboard within the Bastion session.](../../resources/images/lab00_02_BastionClipboard.png "Bastion Clipboard")

1. Click the arrows which will expand the window

     ![Clipboard within the Bastion session.](../../resources/images/lab00_02_UsingBastionClipboard_1.png "Bastion Clipboard")

1. Within the clipboard windows enter the following (replacing **10.2.0.4** with the IP address of your private endpoint)

    ``` bash
    psql -h 10.2.0.4 -p 5432 -U pgadmin northwind
    
    ```

    Enter the password for the **PGAdmin** login you created in the previous task.

    ![Connecting to the Flexible Server within the Bastion session.](../../resources/images/lab02_01_PostgreSQLFlexibleServer_Connection_Bastion.png "Bastion Clipboard")

1. You need to bring across the user and permissions for the web application to connect to the database. Which requires running a setup script in the migrated database. Run the script below in the bastion clipboard:

    ``` sql
    CREATE USER demouser WITH PASSWORD 'demopass123';
    GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO demouser;
    GRANT EXECUTE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA public TO demouser;
    ```

    ![Running the SQL script when connected to the database using Cloud Shell](../../resources/images/lab02_01_RunDatabaseScript.png "SQL script run against database")

1. You can quit out of the psql client session by typing the following:

    ``` bash
    \q
    ```

At this point, things are ready for you to configure the web application to use the migrated database.
