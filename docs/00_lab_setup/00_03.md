1. Open a new browser window, then navigate to the following `http://` URL to access the simulated on-premises web application provisioned for this lab. Be sure to replace the `<ip-address>` placeholder with the **Public IP Address** for the VM.

    ```text

1. When the web page loads, you may enter the following to the end of the URL.

    ```text
    http://<ip-address>/orders.php

    for example http://74.235.231.226/orders.php
    ```
